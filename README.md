# Learn_React: A Topic-Wise Roadmap

## Functional Components

**Functional Components**.

- **JSX**  
  Understand how JSX lets you write HTML-like code in JavaScript.

- **Props vs State**  
  Learn the difference between external data (props) and internal data (state).

- **Conditional Rendering**  
  Render different UI based on conditions using `if`, `&&`, ternary, or switch statements.

- **Composition**  
  Build UIs by composing smaller components into larger ones.


## Rendering

- **Component Lifecycle**  
  Understand the rendering lifecycle in both **class-based** and **functional** components (via `useEffect`).

- **List and Keys**  
  Learn how to render lists efficiently and the importance of using `key` props.

- **Render Props**  
  A pattern for sharing logic using a prop whose value is a function.

- **Refs**  
  Access and manipulate DOM elements directly using `useRef`.

- **Events**  
  Handling events like clicks, input changes, and form submissions in React.

- **Higher-Order Components (HOCs)**  
  Enhance components by wrapping them with logic or data via HOCs.

## Hooks

- **useState**  
  Add state to functional components.

- **useEffect**  
  Handle side effects like API calls, timeouts, subscriptions.

- **useContext**  
  Access global/shared state without prop drilling.

- **useMemo**  
  Optimize performance by memoizing expensive calculations.

- **useReducer**  
  An alternative to `useState` for complex state logic.

- **useCallback**  
  Prevent unnecessary function recreations on re-render.

- **useRef**  
  Persist values across renders without triggering re-renders.


## Advanced Hooks Concepts

- **Creating Custom Hooks**  
  Reuse logic across components by writing your own hooks.

- **Hooks Best Practices**  
  Naming conventions, dependency arrays, avoiding anti-patterns.
